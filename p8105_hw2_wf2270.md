Read the precipitation data from 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )
  
precip_df = left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
head(precip_df)
```

The first dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collector collects the trash and store it in a dumpster. This
dataset contained detailed information on year, month and trash
collected, including some specific kinds of trash. There are a total of
344 observations in our final dataset. Each observation has a unique
“dumpster” number, while the corresponding year, date, weight of
trash(in tons), volume of trash(in cubic yards) and the number some
specific kinds of trash will be recorded.

The second dataset includes month precipitation data from year 2018 and
2017. There are a total of 24 observations in our final dataset. Each
observation includes the total precipitation corresponding to specific
month and year.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33. The median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.

# Problem 2

``` r
NYC_transit = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(c(line:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada)) %>%
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE),
         vending = recode(vending, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(route1:route11), as.character) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_name",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_number" ) %>%

This NYC\_transit dataset contains information related to each entrance
and exit for each subway station in NYC, it has 4270 observations and 10
variables in my dataset after cleaning. For each observations, there are
variables describing line, station name, station latitude, station
longitude, whether it’s an entry, whether it has vending machine, the
entrance type, whether it’s ADA compliant, and the route name and route
number.

After reading in the data, I first clean the variables names, select my
interested variables, convert the entry and vending columns into logical
values. Then since the route data is spread across 11 columns, I use
pivot\_longer to reformat route1:route11 into a route name column, with
their corresponding value stored in route number column. To retain the
route served, I drop those observation with route number=NA. The
dimension of the resulting dataset is 4270 x 10 , I think they are tidy
now.

Answer questions:

  - There are 465 distinct stations.

  - There are 84 stations are ADA compliant.

  - The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.310962.

Route number and route name have been reformated in the data cleaning
process above. There are 60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the
stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

# Problem 3

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day
variable.

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(year:day), as.integer) %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.name[month], # change month number to name
    president = ifelse(prez_gop == 0,"dem","gop")) %>% #create president variable
  subset(select = -c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day))

head(pols_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 9
    ##    year month    gov_gop sen_gop rep_gop gov_dem sen_dem rep_dem president
    ##   <int> <chr>      <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>

    ## 2  1947 February      23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ## 3  1947 March         23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ## 4  1947 April         23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ## 5  1947 May           23      51     253      23      45     198 dem      
    ## 6  1947 June          23      51     253      23      45     198 dem

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

``` r
snp_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(month:year), as.integer) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%#arrange according to year and month
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% # change month number to name
  subset(select = -day) %>%
  relocate(year, month)

head(snp_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 3
    ##    year month    close
    ##   <int> <chr>    <dbl>
    ## 1  1950 January   17.0
    ## 2  1950 February  17.2
    ## 3  1950 March     17.3
    ## 4  1950 April     18.0
    ## 5  1950 May       18.8
    ## 6  1950 June      17.7

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

``` r
month_df2 = tibble(
    mon = month.abb,
    month = month.name,
    month_number = 1:12
  )

unemployment_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "mon",
    values_to = "unempoyment" ) %>%
  drop_na(unempoyment) %>%
  left_join(month_df2, by = "mon") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate_at("year", as.integer) %>%
  arrange(year, month_number) %>% # arrange according to year and month
  subset(select = -c(mon, month_number)) %>%
  relocate(year, month)

head(unemployment_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 3
    ##    year month    unempoyment
    ##   <int> <chr>          <dbl>
    ## 1  1948 January          3.4
    ## 2  1948 February         3.8
    ## 3  1948 March            4  
    ## 4  1948 April            3.9
    ## 5  1948 May              3.5
    ## 6  1948 June             3.6

Join the datasets.

``` r
final_df = 
  full_join(pols_df, snp_df, c("year", "month")) %>%
  full_join(unemployment_df, c("year", "month"))
head(final_df)
```

The final\_df is merged from the previous 3 datasets using year and
month as keys across datasets. It contains 823 observations of 11
