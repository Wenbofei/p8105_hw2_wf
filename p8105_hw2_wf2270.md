Read the Mr.Trashwheel dataset

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
            range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )

head(trashwheel_df)
```

Read the precipitation data from 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2018) %>%
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(month) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017) %>%
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )
  
precip_df = left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
head(precip_df)
```

The first dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collector collects the trash and store it in a dumpster. This
dataset contained detailed information on year, month and trash
collected, including some specific kinds of trash. There are a total of
344 observations in our final dataset. Each observation has a unique
“dumpster” number, while the corresponding year, date, weight of
trash(in tons), volume of trash(in cubic yards) and the number some
specific kinds of trash will be recorded.

The second dataset includes month precipitation data from year 2018 and
2017. There are a total of 24 observations in our final dataset. Each
observation includes the total precipitation corresponding to specific
month and year.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33. The median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8
